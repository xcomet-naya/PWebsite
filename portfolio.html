        <div><p align="center">Self-repairing technology is something I am a huge advocate for. The working class is often led to believe that repairs need to be done professionally and that they have to be expensive. The truth is that anyone can do it! It just takes a little bit of time, some effort, and a YouTube account. The first repair I ever completed was a repair for my cousin's son. It was a simple glass repair on his iPad Air. The part cost 20 dollars and took me an hour to complete. I was fourteen years old when I did it and had no prior knowledge, just the hunger to learn. I realized that, with the right tools and resources, anyone can learn how to do basic repairs themselves. It's empowering to be able to fix things on your own and save money in the process. Now I repair 6â€“10 devices per year. Through practice and experience, I have expanded my skills to include more complex repairs, such as replacing digitizers and ports. I have also started offering my services to friends and family, helping them save money on repairs as well.</p>

          <div><h2 align="center">Hand Wired Keyboards</h2></div>
          <a href="Handwiredbuilds.html"><img src="IMG_2763.JPEG"></a>
          <div><p align="center">Most people don't realize that mechanical keyboards have a huge community surrounding them. There are five main parts of a keyboard: the keycaps, switches, stabilizers, plate, PCB, and case. But an even smaller community has a love for hand-wiring, the process of designing your own keyboard from scratch. It starts with CAD, or computer-aided design. You begin by creating the case and plate using CAD software; each design and layout is unique to the user's desires. After CAD, you place your switches on the plate and begin wiring. There are two parts to a wiring diagram, or schematic. The columns and the rows. Rows are composed of horizontal diodes. Columns are composed of vertically arranged wire. Each switch has two pins. One is connected to a row, and the other to a column. After the hardware is finished, it is time for the software. There are many different types of software used, depending on your microcontroller and bootloader. Some common examples include Keyboardfirmwarebuilder and QMK. I have always had an interest in keyboards, but hand-wiring fascinated me in a completely new way. Creating your own tool is extremely satisfying and enjoyable.

            <a href="Arduino.html"><img src="IMG_2534.JPEG"></a>
          <div><p align="center">Arduino is a single-board computer, or SBC, that is commonly used for creating a myriad of projects and prototypes. It is open-source, making it easy for beginners to learn and experiment with coding and electronics. Arduino IDE is the software used to write and upload code to the board; it is a variation of the C and C++ programming languages. This makes it perfect for people all the way from beginners to advanced programmers. I use Arduino to practice making complex and simple circuits and apply code to them. Arduino is compatible with integrated circuits as well, which I work with often. Click on the image above to view my circuits!</p></div>

          <div><p align="center">Linux ricing is the process of using code and programs to customize the appearance and functionality of a Linux distribution. There are hundreds of distributions, but the main ones I work with are Mint, Ubuntu, Arch, RedHat, and Fedora. Each distribution can be used in a desktop environment, which increases the usability of the platforms. The thing that makes Linux unique is how customizable it is. You can change everything, from your font to how your windows behave. I have created several platforms for myself and others using Linux.

          <div><h2 align="center">Mogul</h2></div>
      <img src="Screenshot 2024-07-08 195419.jpg">
          <div><p align="center">Mogul is a project I began in the summer of 2024 with a friend and mentor of mine at Washington University. I noticed that many kids at my school rarely, if ever, check their emails for important messages from teachers and faculty. With this issue in mind, I decided to create a Chrome extension that sent important emails straight from Gmail to the students' phones. This project is composed of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Using Google Cloud Service, Twilio, and Google's developer tools, we created an extension that helps both teachers and students be more present in school.</p>
